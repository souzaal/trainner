    Once the repository image has been made available, whether by mounting
    an image or copying the data to a specific location, it can be served to
    clients using pkg.depotd(1M).  Before doing so, you will need to alter
    the provided repository configuration template to match your environment.

    First, configure pkg.depotd(1M) using SMF (where <data_source> is the
    full path to where the 'repo' directory is located, such as '/mnt' or
    <destination> from the examples in section 2.1):

        svccfg -s application/pkg/server setprop \
            pkg/inst_root=<data_source>
        svccfg -s application/pkg/server setprop pkg/readonly=true

    By default, pkg.depotd(1M) will listen for connections on port 80.  You
    can change this by executing the following command:

        svccfg -s application/pkg/server setprop pkg/port=<port_number>

    You may also wish to review the man pages for pkg.depotd(1M) and pkgrepo(1)
    for additional settings that may need to be changed based on your needs.

    pkg.depotd(1M) can now be started and used for serving packages to pkg(5)
    clients by refreshing the corresponding SMF service configuration and
    enabling the service:

        svcadm refresh application/pkg/server
        svcadm enable application/pkg/server

    To set clients to use only this depot server to retrieve package content
    for the Oracle Solaris 11.2 release, execute the following command on each
    client (where <origin> is the value you provided for 'pkg/inst_root' above):

        pkg set-publisher -G '*' -g <origin> solaris

    Alternatively, clients may be configured to use the depot server as a
    mirror instead, allowing them to retrieve newer packages that may be
    available while still accelerating operations for package content found
    on your depot server (where <origin> is the value you provided for
    'pkg/inst_root' above) or to increase aggregate resources available to
    clients during packaging operations:

        pkg set-publisher -m <origin> solaris

    Please note that you should only use this depot as an origin or a mirror
    on each system.
